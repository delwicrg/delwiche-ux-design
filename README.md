# Re-Design of Movie Theater App
For the re-design I focused on developing the food concession portion of the application. 

## Four files are included in the re-design
1. Persona: fictional user type likely to use the application 
2. Wireflow: detailed layout combining wireframe and flow that describes the users journey and page content
3. Prototype: a sample version of the application used in testing
4. Report: report detailing methodology, results, analysis, and future improvements as well as the testing protocol attached
* To the view the protype (Delwiche,Rosalina_Prototype.pdf) you can use [sketch-web-viewer](https://animaapp.github.io/sketch-web-viewer/) provided by Animapp. Please note sketch-web-viewer will only allow you to view the screens. To view the active prototype, you will need to open the file in sketch and preview.
